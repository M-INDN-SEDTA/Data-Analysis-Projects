### 3. **Objective / Problem / Goal**

Improving student outcomes requires understanding the factors affecting performance and delivering personalized learning interventions.
The goal of this project is to **predict student performance** and develop an **adaptive learning system** to improve academic results.

---

### 4. **Data Source**

Dataset: **Student Performance Dataset**

* Contains student demographics, study habits, and exam scores.
* Features include: `gender`, `race/ethnicity`, `parental level of education`, `lunch`, `test preparation course`, and scores in `math`, `reading`, and `writing`.

---

### 5. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Removed duplicates and null values.
* Converted categorical features into numerical encoding.
* Added engineered features such as:

  * `total_score`, `average_score`, `score_category`.
* Normalized numeric features for modeling.

---

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Key insights include:

* Performance variations based on **parental education level** and **test preparation course completion**.
* Score distribution analysis for different demographics.
* Correlation analysis between features and scores.

**Power BI Dashboards include:**

* Performance trends across demographics.
* Score distribution by category.
* Adaptive learning suggestions based on performance patterns.

---

### 7. **Modeling**

* **Feature Engineering** for richer insights.
* **Machine Learning Models** for performance prediction.
* Achieved robust accuracy in performance prediction.
* Models stored for later use in adaptive learning.

---

### 8. **SQL & Power BI Integration**

* Data loaded into a **SQL database** via Python scripts.
* Created SQL queries for performance analysis.
* Built **Power BI dashboards** using these queries and DAX formulas.
* Exported dashboard and reports for stakeholder use.

---
