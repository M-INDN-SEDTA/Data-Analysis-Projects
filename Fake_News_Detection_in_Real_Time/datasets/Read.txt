⚠️ **Note:**
Due to the large size of the dataset, it cannot be uploaded directly.
Please download the dataset from Kaggle: [Fake News Detection Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets/data)

📂 Place the dataset in the `datasets/` folder (or the current project folder).
Then run either:

* `Fake_News_Detection_in_Real_Time.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook)
* `Fake_News_Detection_in_Real_Time.py` (Python script)

These scripts will generate the following processed datasets:

* `true_and_fake_news_clean.csv`
* `true_and_fake_news_clean_with_features.csv`

Please ensure the project structure is followed as described in **README.md**.
